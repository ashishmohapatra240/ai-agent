# AI Math Agent

An AI agent that can do math for you! Give it a math problem with multiple steps, and it will solve it step by step using tools.

## What does it do?

This agent can:
- Add numbers
- Multiply numbers  
- Divide numbers
- Handle complex math problems with multiple steps

For example, you can ask it: *"Add 6 and 8, then multiply that by 5, and divide it by 4"* and it will work through each step.

## Why is it needed?

LLMs rely only on static pretrained data, which limits their ability to answer realtime or external queries (e.g., todayâ€™s date)
